# Gmail Email Setup Guide

## üö® Current Issue
Your Gmail authentication is failing with error: `535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted`

## üîß Solution: Use App Passwords

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to your Google Account settings: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Navigate to "Security"
3. Enable "2-Step Verification" if not already enabled

### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Select "Mail" as the app
3. Select "Other (Custom name)" as device
4. Enter a name like "Waste Management System"
5. Click "Generate"
6. **Copy the 16-character password** (it will look like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### Step 3: Update Your .env File
```env
EMAIL_USER=your.email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
```

**Important Notes:**
- Use your full Gmail address for `EMAIL_USER`
- Use the 16-character app password (without spaces) for `EMAIL_PASS`
- Do NOT use your regular Gmail password

### Step 4: Test Email Configuration
1. Restart your server
2. Visit: `http://localhost:5000/user/test-email`
3. Check the response and console output

## üîç Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use Gmail OAuth2 (More Secure)
If you prefer OAuth2 authentication, you can set up Gmail API credentials.

### Option 2: Use Different Email Service
Consider using services like:
- **SendGrid** (free tier available)
- **Mailgun** (free tier available)
- **AWS SES** (very cheap)

### Option 3: Use Gmail SMTP with Less Secure Apps (Not Recommended)
‚ö†Ô∏è **This is deprecated and not secure**
```javascript
// Only use this for testing, not production
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  service: 'Gmail',
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
  },
  tls: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
});
```
